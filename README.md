## Chatbot Version 2
This GitHub repository contains the code for my personal chatbot project, rebuilt using the robust capabilities of the LangChain framework.

### Background
I initially created a basic chatbot (v0.1) as a coding novice by following some tutorials. However, it had severe limitations around chunking, embeddings, databases, metadata and memory. Eager to improve, I struggled through more advanced AI courses without much success.

Eventually LangChain's modular pipelines helped me reconstruct a more capable chatbot (v2) from the ground up. This repo chronicles that rebuilding journey using LangChainâ€™s tools for:

- Ingesting blog data
- Embedding text
- Indexing vectors
- Retrieving context
- Architecting conversational agent logic
While still a work-in-progress, v2 shows significantly more intelligence in query responses while maintaining dialogue context.

### Key Components
- DataIngestionAndIndexing.ipynb: Jupyter notebook detailing the process of ingesting data from a source and indexing it for the chatbot.
- xml_to_json_html.py: Python script used to transform WordPress exports into structured HTML and JSON, suitable for ingestion by the chatbot.
- all_posts.json: The example output JSON file containing the processed blog posts ready for use by the chatbot.
- example_app.py: The full example application showcasing the chatbot in action.

## Version 2 improvements
The transition from `example_app.py` to `example_app_v2.py` introduces several key improvements to enhance the chatbot's functionality, performance, and user experience:
- **Framework Upgrade**: Migrated from Flask to FastAPI to leverage asynchronous request handling, improving scalability and performance.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Using Langsmith to better logging and observing how the app is performing.
